  because two separate services will be too chatty, or where no clear boundaries exist between the domain lines of a service.

2.Don't consider using microservices unless your organization is willing to invest in the automation and operational work (monitoring,
  scaling) that a highly distributed application needs to be successful.

  tasks such as creating, adding, and performing simple (non-complex) queries against a store.  --这里是讲微服务自身的'属性'而不是它'应该'开发成什么样
